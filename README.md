#What's His Deal?

A web app based off of Mindy Kaling's talk at Made With Code.

####The Problem
Sometimes it's impossible to know what's up with a guy. People are driven by a need to understand human interaction, and we help them reach that understanding.

####The Approach
We took a primarily comedic approach. Obviously, there is no real analysis going on here, nor do we truly pretend to have the answers to someone's relationship problems.

####Analysis
It's pretty funny to us, at least. We're hoping to tweet it to Mindy... maybe we'll win her love and affection.

####Resources
Color scheme inspired by [this](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/2898062/Pinkie_Pie) palette.

The original app idea this is adapted from is of course courtesy of Mindy Kaling.

The code for Drag and Drop of images is derived from source code [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp) at w3schools. The w3schools code only provided for dragging an image from one part of a page to another part of the same page, and did so using the deprecated HTML event handlers.

The code that reads an image into the web page is derived from source code at [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/), courtesy of Eric Bidelman.
