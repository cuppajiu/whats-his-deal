#What's His Deal?

A web app based off of Mindy Kaling's talk at Made With Code.

##Problem Domain Exploration

###Why does this company want a website?
This website is a means for the company to introduce and sell its app to those who visit the website.

The website will hypothetically generate revenue from theoretical app sales.

###Problems being solved
Sometimes it's impossible to know what's up with a guy. People are driven by a need to understand human interaction, and we help them reach that understanding.

###The approach we took
We took a primarily comedic approach. Obviously, there is no real analysis going on here, nor do we truly pretend to have the answers to someone's relationship problems.

###Analysis of the Results
It's pretty funny to us, at least. We're hoping to tweet it to Mindy... maybe we'll win her love and affection.

###Resources
Color scheme inspired by [this](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/2898062/Pinkie_Pie) palette.
App idea is of course courtesy of Mindy Kaling.

The code for Drag and Drop of images is derived from source code [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp) at w3schools. The w3schools code only provided for dragging an image from
one part of a page to another part of the same page, and did so using the deprecated HTML event handlers.

The code that reads an image into the web page is derived from source code at [here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/), courtesy of Eric Bidelman.
