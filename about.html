        <p class="aboutText">
          What's His Deal is a novelty website inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IscstLkpZ-M">talk</a> Mindy Kaling gave at Made With Code in 2014.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          The idea of the game is to insert a conversation you've had with a guy where you had no idea what his deal was, and we'll tell you what it is! It's supposed to be silly and all in good fun.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
          It was created at Code Fellows by Hannah, Lily, and Charles.
